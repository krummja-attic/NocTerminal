Description: # NocTerminal
        
        NocTerminal is a project borne out of two things, (a) frustration with a messy game engine constantly tripping over itself, and (b) the unwieldable lich energy of a bored programmer stuck at home.
        
        NocTerminal is, in short, a wrapper application that I am building to harness my Python-TCOD based Roguelike game + engine, Simulacra. The goal of the NocTerminal project is to build a content-agnostic framework that handles all of the necessary input handling, view rendering, and data management for Simulacra. Ideally this results in a consistent, easily modifiable API for both Simulacra and future Roguelike projects. You might think of this project as an opinionated "homebrew" configuration of the TCOD Roguelike engine.
